# Azure core client library for Android

This is the core library for the Azure SDK for Android, containing the HTTP pipeline, as well as a shared set of
components that are used across all client libraries, including pipeline policies, error types, serialization classes,
and a logging system. As an end user, you don't need to manually install azure-core because it will be installed
automatically when you install other SDK libraries. If you are a client library developer, please reference the
[azure-storage-blob](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-android/tree/master/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob) library
as an example of how to use the shared azure-core components in your client library.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
* The client library natively target Android API level 21. Your application's `minSdkVersion` must be set to 21 or
  higher to use this library.
* The library is written in Java 8. Your application must be built with Android Gradle Plugin 3.0.0 or later, and must
  be configured to
  [enable Java 8 language desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support.html#supported_features)
  to use this library. Java 8 language features that require a target API level >21 are not used, nor are any Java 8+
  APIs that would require the Java 8+ API desugaring provided by Android Gradle plugin 4.0.0.
* You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) to use this library.

### Install the library
At the present time, to install the Azure core client library for Android you must download the latest
[release](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-android/releases) and integrate it into your project manually:

#### Manually integrate the library into your project

To manually integrate this library into your project, first download the latest releases of the following libraries from
the repository's [Releases](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-android/releases) page:

* `azure-core`

Place the libraries' .aar files in your application module's `libs` directory, and modify your application module's
`build.gradle` file, updating (or adding) the `fileTree` dependency targeting the `libs` directory to include .aar
files.

If you plan to use the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Android](http://aka.ms/aadv2) in your project, add
it by following the library's
[installation instructions](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-android#using-msal).

## Key concepts

The main shared concepts of azure-core (and thus, Azure SDK libraries using azure-core) include:

- Configuring service clients, e.g. policies, logging (`RequestIdInterceptor` et al., `ClientLogger`).
- Accessing HTTP response details (`Response`, `ServiceCall`).
- Exceptions for reporting errors from service requests in a consistent fashion. (`AzureException`).
- Classes for serializing and deserializing common HTTP bodies used by Azure services (`DateTimeSerializer` et al.)

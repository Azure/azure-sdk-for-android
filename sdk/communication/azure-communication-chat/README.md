# Azure Communication Chat Service client library for Android

This package contains the Chat client library for Azure Communication Services.

[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-android/tree/master/sdk/communication/azure-communication-chat)
| [API reference documentation](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-android/sdk/communication/azure-communication-chat/azure-communication-chat/index.html)
| [Product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/overview)

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

* You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and a [Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource) to use this library.
* The client libraries natively target Android API level 21. Your application's minSdkVersion must be set to 21 or higher to use this library.
* The library is written in Java 8. Your application must be built with Android Gradle plugin 3.0.0 or later, and must be configured to [enable Java 8 language desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support.html#supported_features) to use this library. Java 8 language features that require a target API level > 21 are not used, nor are any Java 8+ APIs that would require the Java 8+ API desugaring provided by Android Gradle plugin 4.0.0.

### Versions available
The current Azure Communication Chat Service Version is **2020-11-01-preview3**.

The current Azure Communication Chat SDK Version is **1.0.0-beta.6**.

> Note: The SDK is currently in **beta**. The API surface and feature sets are subject to change at any time before they become generally available. We do not currently recommend them for production use.

### Install the library
To install the Azure client libraries for Android, add them as dependencies within your
[Gradle](#add-a-dependency-with-gradle) or
[Maven](#add-a-dependency-with-maven) build files.

#### Add a dependency with Gradle
To import the library into your project using the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build system, follow the instructions in [Add build dependencies](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/dependencies):

Add an `implementation` configuration to the `dependencies` block of your app's `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file, specifying the library's name and the version you wish to use:

```gradle
// build.gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation "com.azure.android:azure-communication-chat:1.0.0-beta.6"
}

// build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation("com.azure.android:azure-communication-chat:1.0.0-beta.6")
}
```

#### Add a dependency with Maven
To import the library into your project using the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) build system, add it to the `dependencies` section of your app's `pom.xml` file, specifying its artifact ID and the version you wish to use:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.azure.android</groupId>
  <artifactId>azure-communication-chat</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-beta.6</version>
</dependency>
```

### Create the ChatClient

Use the `ChatAsyncClient.Builder` to configure and create an instance of `ChatAsyncClient`.

```java
import com.azure.android.communication.chat.ChatAsyncClient;
import com.azure.android.core.http.HttpHeader;

final String endpoint = "https://<resource>.communication.azure.com";
final String userAccessToken = "<user_access_token>";

ChatAsyncClient client = new ChatAsyncClient.Builder()
        .endpoint(endpoint)
        .credentialInterceptor(chain -> chain.proceed(chain.request()
                .newBuilder()
                .header(HttpHeader.AUTHORIZATION, "Bearer " + userAccessToken)
                .build()))
        .build();
```

### Create the threadClient

Now that we've created a Chat thread we'll obtain a `threadClient` to perform operations within the thread.

```java
ChatThreadAsyncClient threadClient =
        new ChatThreadAsyncClient.Builder()
                .endpoint(endpoint)
                .credentialInterceptor(chain -> chain.proceed(chain.request()
                        .newBuilder()
                        .header(HttpHeader.AUTHORIZATION, "Bearer " + userAccessToken)
                        .build()))
                .build();
```
Replace `<endpoint>` with your Communication Services endpoint.

## Key concepts

### Users and User Access Tokens

User access tokens enable you to build client applications that directly authenticate to Azure Communication Services. Refer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/access-tokens) to learn how to create a user and issue a User Access Token.

The id for the user created above will be necessary later to add said user as a participant of a new chat thread. 

### Chat Thread

A chat conversation is represented by a chat thread. Each user in the thread is called a thread participant. Thread participants can chat with one another privately in a 1:1 chat or huddle up in a 1:N group chat. 

### Chat operations

Once you initialize an `ChatClient` class, you can perform the following chat operations:

#### Thread Operations

- [Create a thread](#create-a-thread)
- [Get a thread](#get-a-thread)
- [List threads](#list-threads)
- [Update a thread](#update-a-thread)
- [Delete a thread](#delete-a-thread)

#### Message Operations

- [Send a message](#send-a-message)
- [Get a message](#get-a-message)
- [List messages](#list-messages)
- [Update a message](#update-a-message)
- [Delete a message](#delete-a-message)

#### Thread Participant Operations

- [Get thread participants](#get-thread-participants)
- [Add thread participants](#add-thread-participants)
- [Remove a thread participant](#remove-a-thread-participant)

#### Events Operations

- [Send a typing notification](#send-a-typing-notification)
- [Send a read receipt](#send-read-receipt)
- [Get read receipts](#get-read-receipts)

## Examples

#### Create a thread

Use the `create` method to create a thread.

```java
//  The list of ChatParticipant to be added to the thread.
List<ChatParticipant> participants = new ArrayList<>();
// The display name for the thread participant.
String displayName = "initial participant";
participants.add(new ChatParticipant()
        .setId(id)
        .setDisplayName(displayName)
);


// The topic for the thread.
final String topic = "General";
// The model to pass to the create method.
CreateChatThreadRequest thread = new CreateChatThreadRequest()
        .setTopic(topic)
        .setParticipants(participants);

// optional, set a repeat request ID
final String repeatabilityRequestID = "";

client.createChatThread(thread, repeatabilityRequestID, new Callback<CreateChatThreadResult>() {
    public void onSuccess(CreateChatThreadResult result, okhttp3.Response response) {
        ChatThread chatThread = result.getChatThread();
        threadId = chatThread.getId();
        // take further action
        Log.i(TAG, "threadId: " + threadId);
    }

    public void onFailure(Throwable throwable, okhttp3.Response response) {
        // Handle error.
        Log.e(TAG, throwable.getMessage());
    }
});
```

For more examples, please go to [Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/chat/get-started?pivots=programming-language-android) doc.

## Troubleshooting

When an error occurs, the client calls the callback's `onFailure` method. You can use the provided `Throwable` to act upon the failure.

```java
client.createChatThread(thread, new Callback<CreateChatThreadResult>() {
    public void onFailure(Throwable throwable, okhttp3.Response response) {
        // Handle error.
    }
});
```

## Next steps

Check the code examples in quickstart doc, create an Android app to test it out.

# Azure Communication Common client library for Android

This package contains common code for Azure Communication Service libraries.

[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-android/tree/master/sdk/communication/azure-communication-common)
| [API reference documentation](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-android/sdk/communication/azure-communication-common/azure-communication-common/index.html)
| [Product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/overview)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
* You must have an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and a
  [Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource) to use this library.
* The client libraries natively target Android API level 21. Your application's `minSdkVersion` must be set to 21 or
  higher to use this library.
* The library is written in Java 8. Your application must be built with Android Gradle Plugin 3.0.0 or later, and must
  be configured to
  [enable Java 8 language desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support.html#supported_features)
  to use this library. Java 8 language features that require a target API level >21 are not used, nor are any Java 8+
  APIs that would require the Java 8+ API desugaring provided by Android Gradle plugin 4.0.0.

### Versions available
The current version of this library is **1.0.0-beta.5**.

> Note: The SDK is currently in **beta**. The API surface and feature sets are subject to change at any time before they become generally available. We do not currently recommend them for production use.

### Install the library
To install the Azure client libraries for Android, add them as dependencies within your
[Gradle](#add-a-dependency-with-gradle) or
[Maven](#add-a-dependency-with-maven) build scripts.

#### Add a dependency with Gradle
To import the library into your project using the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build system, follow the instructions in [Add build dependencies](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/dependencies):

Add an `implementation` configuration to the `dependencies` block of your app's `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file, specifying the library's name and the version you wish to use:

```gradle
// build.gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation "com.azure.android:azure-communication-common:1.0.0-beta.7"
}

// build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation("com.azure.android:azure-communication-common:1.0.0-beta.7")
}
```

#### Add a dependency with Maven
To import the library into your project using the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) build system, add it to the `dependencies` section of your app's `pom.xml` file, specifying its artifact ID and the version you wish to use:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.azure.android</groupId>
  <artifactId>azure-communication-common</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-beta.7</version>
</dependency>
```

### Key concepts

### CommunicationTokenCredential

A `CommunicationTokenCredential` authenticates a user with Communication Services, such as Chat or Calling. It optionally
provides an auto-refresh mechanism to ensure a continuously stable authentication state during communications. User
tokens are created by the application developer using the Communication Administration SDK - once created, they are
provided to the various Communication Services client libraries by way of a `CommunicationTokenCredential` object.

## Examples

The following sections provide several code snippets showing different ways to use a `CommunicationTokenCredential`:

* [Creating a credential with a static token](#creating-a-credential-with-a-static-token)
* [Creating a credential that refreshes with a Callable](#creating-a-credential-that-refreshes-with-a-callable)
* [Creating a credential that refreshes proactively](#creating-a-credential-that-refreshes-proactively)
* [Creating a credential with an initial value that refreshes proactively](#creating-a-credential-with-an-initial-value-that-refreshes-proactively)
* [Getting a token asynchronously](#getting-a-token-asynchronously)
* [Invalidating a credential](#invalidating-a-credential)

### Creating a credential with a static token

```java
CommunicationTokenCredential userCredential = new CommunicationTokenCredential("eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjM2MDB9.adM-ddBZZlQ1WlN3pdPBOF5G4Wh9iZpxNP_fSvpF4cWs");
```

### Creating a credential that refreshes with a Callable

Here we pass an imagined `Callable<String>` that makes a network request to retrieve a token string for user Bob. It will be called on a background thread.

```java
Callable<String> tokenRefresher = () -> {
  return fetchtoken();
};

CommunicationTokenCredential userCredential = new CommunicationTokenCredential(new CommunicationTokenRefreshOptions(tokenRefresher, false));
```

### Creating a credential that refreshes proactively

Setting `refreshProactively` to true will call your `Callable<String> tokenRefresher` when the token is close to expiry.

```java
CommunicationTokenCredential userCredential = new CommunicationTokenCredential(new CommunicationTokenRefreshOptions(tokenRefresher, true));
```

### Creating a credential with an initial value that refreshes proactively

Passing `initialToken` is an optional optimization to skip the first call to `Callable<String> tokenRefresher`. You can use this to separate the boot from your application from subsequent token refresh cycles.

```java
CommunicationTokenCredential userCredential = new CommunicationTokenCredential(new CommunicationTokenRefreshOptions(tokenRefresher, true, "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjM2MDB9.adM-ddBZZlQ1WlN3pdPBOF5G4Wh9iZpxNP_fSvpF4cWs"));
```

### Getting a token asynchronously

Calling `getToken()` will return a `CompletableFuture<AccessToken>`

```java
CommunicationTokenCredential userCredential = new CommunicationTokenCredential(new CommunicationTokenRefreshOptions(tokenRefresher, false));
CompletableFuture<AccessToken> accessTokenFuture = userCredential.getToken();
```

### Invalidating a credential

Each `CommunicationTokenCredential` instance uses a background thread for refreshing the cached token. To free up resources and facilitate garbage collection, `dispose()` must be called when the `CommunicationTokenCredential` instance is no longer used.

```java
userCredential.dispose();
```
